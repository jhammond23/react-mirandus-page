These rocks are so common that Orc bands have inhabited cracks and fissures for centuries, forcing them to build their homes within. Only by chance and accident did many orcs meet their deaths as they slid or tumbled. Accidental impalements were not uncommon, especially among seasoned fighters.

        The orcs were made to be the ultimate killing machine, and they have remained so ever since. They are not known for their great dexterity or balance, but only those with the toughest flesh and the greatest ability to heal could survive and thrive throughout history. The healing orcs of this region were known by outsiders as the Bone Orcs over time. Their natural healing abilities are so potent that even broken bones are said to be mended rapidly and with ease. They have now taken pride in being referred to as Exemplars, having a talent called Improved Mending.`,

Unlike the majority of orcs, who are uninterested in the inner workings of their bodies, the Clear Bloods have a strong focus on medicines. But to outsiders, most of their dozens of medicines are considered deadly poisons.

        Some Clear Bloods are able to build immunities not only to the effects of those poisons but also to the consequences of all other poisons in the world by regularly administering these medicines throughout their lives. In order to be initiated into the Clear Blood, orcs must endure a number of painful procedures. However, as Exemplars, Clear Bloods are immune to almost any poison because to their inherited trait called Toxin Release.`,

They’ve embraced a level of insight that’s well beyond the comprehension of humans, allowing them to detect aggression and fear in others. These orcs are nearly impossible to deceive, since they almost always have advance warning.
