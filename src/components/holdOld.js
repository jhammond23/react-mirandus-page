Searching for the greatest riches on the stones is frequently a needle-in-a-haystack task, especially because little gems are sometimes valued by their scarcity. In these cases, it’s usually best to develop a strong working relationship with the dwarves: they will be more than happy to extract valuable minerals in exchange for some of your excess goods, and always seem to have an extra pick-ax when yours breaks. Dwarven mining equipment is famous (or infamous) for its incredible strength and reliability; an average pick-axe made out of standard brass will last through about 60,000 strikes before it needs to be replaced. Dwarven mining equipment is not normally available for purchase; one must become a valued client of the dwarves in order to procure some of their produce. However, certain nobles and wealthy merchants are rumored to own some expertly crafted dwarven pick-axes (rumored to be worth thousands of gold coins, thanks to their durability).

                The Hollowers have made intuition a priority in their history, and they’ve focused on it. They may sense unseen fractures within the stones, allowing them to extract the most out of each strike with their hammer or pick. Some even say that the greatest Hollowers can sense the exact location of the sought treasure and uncover it with no wasted time at all. Others simply make the case the Hollowers are consistently lucky.
                
                Despite the fact that these Exemplars don’t display a fracture-preventing ability, they do have a characteristic called Feel for Fractures. This trait allows them to mine without expending as much energy.`,

Whisper is the game that determines public standing in Mumsend, and while it may appear to be a silly game, the outcomes are enforceable across the town.

                Whisper has a complex set of rules, but the basic idea is that Mumsends try to sneak up on their pals and neighbors and scare them out of their minds with a quiet greeting. Those who elicit the most startles earn the greatest degrees of respect from society. For many Mumsends, the game has had a significant impact on their lives, for better or worse.

The Glimmering Clan has a reputation of being very good hagglers, with members always trying to buy things cheaply and sell them for more expensive prices.

    These mining professionals, like those who search for gold or silver in streams, seem to be guided by something deeper than a desire for money. They rummage through mounds of mining debris, regardless of the size of the “waste” pile.
    
    When the Glimmering Clan appears on a busy mining site, the leaders of the operation are frequently frustrated since they find ore that had been overlooked.

Searching for the greatest riches on the stones is frequently a needle-in-a-haystack task, especially because little gems are sometimes valued by their scarcity. In these cases, it’s usually best to develop a strong working relationship with the dwarves: they will be more than happy to extract valuable minerals in exchange for some of your excess goods, and always seem to have an extra pick-ax when yours breaks. Dwarven mining equipment is famous (or infamous) for its incredible strength and reliability; an average pick-axe made out of standard brass will last through about 60,000 strikes before it needs to be replaced. Dwarven mining equipment is not normally available for purchase; one must become a valued client of the dwarves in order to procure some of their produce. However, certain nobles and wealthy merchants are rumored to own some expertly crafted dwarven pick-axes (rumored to be worth thousands of gold coins, thanks to their durability).

    The Hollowers have made intuition a priority in their history, and they’ve focused on it. They may sense unseen fractures within the stones, allowing them to extract the most out of each strike with their hammer or pick. Some even say that the greatest Hollowers can sense the exact location of the sought treasure and uncover it with no wasted time at all. Others simply make the case the Hollowers are consistently lucky.
