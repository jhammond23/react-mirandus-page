        These Elves are credited with preserving time for the human race on numerous occasions throughout history. They are regarded as the keepers of time by some of the nation’s oldest tales, and they have saved the world on many occasions. It is thought that they may be found in all time. If this is true, it implies that they have a unique and helpful knowledge of not just the past, but also the future. The Allsights’ exceptional expertise with projectile weapons is due to their greatly improved eyesight.
        
        Allsight Elves are exemplars. They get a bonus to ranged weapons, but perhaps more significantly, Allsight Elves have a boost to chance encounters that range from chances from the ability Futurus to advantages in battle.`,

Elves come in a variety of different varieties throughout Mirandus. Despite the fact that the types vary in many ways and attribute various origins to their abilities, they all acknowledge that they are descendants of the same Elven forefathers.

        The Brightsun Elves are the elves of the sun. The sun is seen as the source of all power and the giver of everything that has been exposed to its rays. They are described as “clothed in brilliant light” and as Exemplars, they have a unique power.

Rather, Darksuns are often quite kind and peaceful, even compared to other Elven clans. They have a unique sense of wise acceptance towards life. The Darksuns’ longevity is largely attributed to this. They are, in essence, a Doomsday Religion with the apocalypse of darkness they anticipate as their ultimate triumph fast approaching.

        Your Darksun Elf Exemplar may not give you the otherworldly wisdom of the Darksuns, but you’ll definitely get their ability to see at night. You’ll know what’s coming in the dark. When others cannot see you, you can still see them.
